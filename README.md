# Basic and useful examples for NodeMCU using Arduino IDE
In this repository you can find some basic examples like fade in a led, read from analog input, or how to use the WiFi connection in the NodeMCU board using Arduino IDE.
## Examples:
- wifi-connection: It shows how to connect a wifi access point.
- fade-in-led: It shows how to control the PWM output to fade in a led (or change the speed of a engine).
- analog-read: An example of analog reading. For example, a LDR fotoresistor.
- ultrasonic-sensor: Code showing how to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance.
- wifi-server: An example of web server to swith LED status.
